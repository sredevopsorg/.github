# About Us

[![About Us: SREDevOps.org](https://www.sredevops.org/content/images/2024/11/sredevopsorg.svg)](https://www.sredevops.org)

At **SREDevOps.org, we’re all about helping people and organizations thrive using open-source technology**. We truly believe that when tools and knowledge are shared openly, everyone wins. It’s the best way to drive innovation and help the whole tech community grow together. For us, it’s not just about the code—it’s about building a diverse, fair space where everyone can contribute to solving complex problems. **We aim for a long-term, sustainable approach that uses technology to make a real, positive impact on society.**

If you’re looking to sharpen your skills, we’ve got plenty of resources to help. We regularly put out news, tutorials, and deep-dive guides on everything from Linux and Docker to Kubernetes, AI, and Cloud Native tech. But we’re more than just a content site; we’re a global community. We connect professionals through meetups, workshops, and webinars so we can all stay on top of industry trends and help each other solve real-world challenges. **Whether your focus is on SRE, DevSecOps, Platform Engineering, or ethical hacking, you'll find a home here.**

Our team is led by Nicolás Georger, who founded the site, alongside Diego Mondini, our lead in Brazil, Rudy Pinochet, who supports us as an advisor and collaborator and Manuel Morejón as a writer and collaborator. To make sure our resources reach as many people as possible, we offer content in [Español / Castellano](https://www.sredevops.org/es/), [English](https://www.sredevops.org/en/) and [Portuguese](https://www.sredevops.org/br/).
